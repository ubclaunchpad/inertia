## inertia

Effortless, self-hosted continuous deployment for small teams and projects

### Synopsis

Inertia is an effortless, self-hosted continuous deployment platform ðŸš€ 

Initialization involves preparing a server to run an application, then
activating a daemon which will continuously update the production server
with new releases as they become available in the project's repository.

Once you have set up a remote with 'inertia remote add [remote]', use 
'inertia [remote] --help' to see what you can do with your remote. To list
available remotes, use 'inertia remote ls'.

Global inertia configuration is stored in '~/.inertia/inertia.global'.
