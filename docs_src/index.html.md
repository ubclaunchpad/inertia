*Inertia* is a simple cross-platform command line application that enables quick
and easy setup and management of continuous, automated deployment of a variety
of project types on any virtual private server. The project is used, built, and
maintained with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [UBC Launch Pad](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com), UBC's
student-run software engineering club.

[UBC Launch Pad](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com) is a student-run software
engineering club at the University of British Columbia that aims to provide
students with a community where they can work together to build a all sorts of
cool projects, ranging from mobile apps and web services to cryptocurrencies and
machine learning applications.

Many of our projects rely on hosting providers for deployment. Unfortunately we
frequently change hosting providers based on available funding and sponsorship,
meaning our projects often need to be redeployed. On top of that, deployment
itself can already be a frustrating task, especially for students with little to
no experience setting up applications on remote hosts. Inertia is a project we
started to address these problems.

This site primarily documents how to set up and use Inertia - to learn more
about the project, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia)!
A complete command reference for the Inertia CLI is also available [here](/cli).
If you're interested in building on Inertia, check out the [API reference](/api).

If you're looking for the latest pre-release documentation, check out the
[*preview* versions of our documentation](https://inertia.ubclaunchpad.com/tip).
Note that `/tip` documentation includes unreleased features and changes.

</aside>

# Getting Started
> MacOS users can install the CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install ubclaunchpad/tap/inertia
```

> Node.js users can install the CLI using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): 

```shell
npm install -g inertia-cli
```

> Windows users can install the CLI using [Scoop](http://scoop.sh):

```shell
scoop bucket add ubclaunchpad https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/scoop-bucket
scoop install inertia
```

> To build and install the CLI from source:

```shell
go get -u github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia
```

The Inertia command line interface (CLI) can be installed from a few package
managers such as npm, Homebrew and Scoop. For other platforms, you can 
[download the appropriate binary from the Releases page](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/releases).

You can also build Inertia from source, though this requires Golang to be
installed.

To verify your installation, try running `inertia --help` - this should output
some helpful text about Inertia.

Run `inertia --version` to verify that you have the
[latest release](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/releases/latest).

## Setup

> This will generate a configuration file inside your repository:

```
cd /path/to/project
inertia init
```

To set up Inertia, you must first navigate to your project directory, which
must be a git repository, and run `inertia init` to set up configuration. If
Inertia cannot detect your project type, it will prompt for more information.

If you haven't yet, Inertia will also instantiate a global configuration file
for you. To create this file separately, run `inertia init --global`.

<aside class="notice">
To use your project with Inertia, you must have some kind of
<a href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/'>Docker</a> or
<a href='https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/'>docker-compose</a>
configuration set up for running your app.
</aside>

## Project Configuration

> An example `inertia.toml`:

```toml
name = "my_project"
url = "git@github.com:ubclaunchpad/my_project.git"

[[profile]]
  name = "default"
  branch = "master"
  [profile.build]
    type = "dockerfile"
    buildfile = "Dockerfile"
```

> To change a setting, you can edit the configuration file directly, or run:

```shell
inertia project set ${parameter} ${new_value}
```

> Profiles can be updated or created using the `inertia project profile` commands:

```shell
inertia project profile configure new_profile \
  --build.type dockerfile \
  --build.file Dockerfile.dev
```

Your Inertia configuration is stored in `inertia.toml` by default. There are
a few project-wide settings stored here:

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`name`    | The name of the project you are deploying.
`url`     | Your project source, typically your Git repository.

A `profile` configures how to run your project, and you can set multiple profiles
to declare different 'modes' of deploying your project (for example, to differentiate
between a `staging` and `dev` deployment). A `profile` contains the following
fields:

Parameter         | Description
----------------- | -----------
`name`            | The name of your profile - must be unique.
`branch`          | The git branch of your project to continuously deploy.
`build.type`      | This should be either `dockerfile` or `docker-compose`, depending on which you are using.
`build.buildfile` | Path to your build configuration file, such as `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`, relative to the root of your project.

# Deploying Your Project

When deploying a project, you typically deploy to a "remote".

A "remote" is a remote VPS, such as a [Google Cloud Compute](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
or [AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance. These
are computers in the cloud that will be used to deploy your project, so that
you don't have to use your own.

If this is your first time setting up a VPS, jump ahead to the
[Provisioning a Remote](#provisioning-a-remote) section, which will help you set
up a VPS for Inertia.

## Using an Existing Remote

> This command will prompt you for the path to your PEM file, your username,
> and the IP address of your remote. These parameters will be used to execute
> SSH commands that set up Inertia on your VPS.

```shell
inertia remote add ${remote_name}
inertia remote ls
```

To use an existing remote, you'll need its address and a PEM key that can be
used to access it. Inertia will also need a few ports exposed, namely one for
the Inertia daemon (port `4303` by default) and whatever ports you need for your
deployed project.

Configured remotes are stored globally in `~/.inertia/inertia.global`.

<aside class="notice">
If you use a non-standard SSH port (i.e. not port <code>22</code>) or want to
use a different port for the Inertia daemon, use the <code>--ssh.port ${port}</code>
and <code>--daemon.port ${port}</code> flags respectively when adding your remote.
</aside>

## Provisioning a Remote

<aside class="notice">
If you've already added a remote manually, you can skip ahead to
<a href='#initializing-the-inertia-daemon'>Initializing the Inertia Daemon</a>.
</aside>

```shell
inertia provision --help
inertia provision ${cloud_provider} ${remote_name}
```

Inertia has integrations with some cloud providers to allow you to easily
provision a new VPS instance and set it up for Inertia. This includes generating
key pairs, setting network rules, and initializing the Inertia daemon.

You can use the `--help` on the `provision` command to see what options are
available.

### Example: Provisioning an EC2 Instance

[Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) is a service provided
by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that can be used to deploy Inertia projects. It
offers [750 free EC2 hours a month for your first 12 months](https://aws.amazon.com/free/),
which is just enough for 1 EC2 VPS instance. Even after the trial it's pretty
affordable, and a good choice to get started with.

> The IAM users page:
> ![](/images/aws-ec2-iam-add.png)

To get started, make an account on the [AWS website](aws.amazon.com). If you're
a student, you'll also be eligible for
[yearly free credits](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), so make sure
you sign up for that as well.

Next, you'll want to head over to the
[IAM page of the AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
IAM stands for "Identity and Access Management", and this is where you'll
configure programmatic access to your AWS account. Under the "Users" tab, click
"Add User".

> Configuring IAM permissions:
> ![](/images/aws-ec2-iam-perm.png)

This will take you through a brief walkthrough to configure your new IAM user:

* Page 1 - make sure you enable **Programmatic Access** to tell AWS to generate
  access keys for your new user - Inertia will need this.
* Page 2 - make sure to choose a permission set that allows the user to
  manipulate EC2 resources, such as **AmazonEC2FullAccess** (this will be
  under the 3rd tab titled "Attach existing policies directly").
* Page 3 - don't worry about setting tags, as these are typically used for
  organizations with large numbers of users.
* Page 4 - confirm that you've configured the user correctly
* Page 5 - you should be shown a **Access Key ID** and a **Secret access key**.
  Copy these somewhere safe!

<aside class="warning">
Make sure you don't reveal your keys to anyone else, as a malicious user could
incur pretty significant charges at your expense.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
If you lose your keys, you can simply
<a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey'>
invalidate and create new keys</a> for the same user (and indeed key rotation on
a regular basis is strongly encouraged by AWS anyway).
</aside>

```shell
# set credentials in environment
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=${access_key_id}
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=${secret_access_key}
inertia provision ec2 my_remote \
  --from-env \
  --ports 8080
```

> This command says: "provision an ec2 instance called 'my_remote' using
> credentials in my environment and expose port 8080 for my project".

Now that you have your user and access keys all set up, you can provision your
remote instance! Just set your keys in your
[shell environment](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-using-variables.htm)
and use the `--from-env` flag as in the example to provision a remote using
those credentials.

Alternatively, you can save your credentials in your
[AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
To use these with Inertia, just call the `provision ec2` command with the
`--from-profile` flag.

Inertia will just prompt you for the keys if you don't provide them using one
of the methods above.

The provisioning command will ask you to choose a
[region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions)
and an [image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) to
use. The region should probably be whatever is closest to you, and then you
should just choose one of the images that Inertia lists as options.

Inertia will then create an EC2 instance, generate a key pair to give you SSH
access to the remote, set up network rules, install Inertia's prerequisites on
your remote, and spin up the Inertia daemon!

## Remote Configuration

> List and show your configured remotes:

```sh
inertia remote ls
inertia remote show ${remote_name}
```

> An example `~/.inertia/inertia.global`:

```toml
# ... other stuff

[[remote]]
  version = "latest"
  name = "staging"
  ip = "123.456.789.123"
  [remote.ssh]
    user = "root"
    identityfile = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    ssh-port = "22"
  [remote.daemon]
    port = "4303"
    token = "weRO5gfUoXFQuBnLuJewGvBehf7A4yVUHxKSF0f3FFc"
    webhook-secret = "ubclaunchpad"
    verify-ssl = false
  [remote.profiles]
    "my_project" = "default"

[[remote]]
  # ... another remote
```

> To change a setting, you can edit the configuration file directly, or run:

```shell
inertia remote set ${remote_name} ${parameter} ${new_value}
```

> For example, the following will change the SSH user for accessing `my_remote`
> to `me` and print out the new settings:

```shell
inertia remote set my_remote ssh.user me
inertia remote show my_remote
```

Once you've added a remote, remote-specific settings are available in
`~/.inertia/inertia.global`.

<aside class="notice">
For the most part, unless you filled in something incorrectly while adding a
remote or provisioning an instance, you won't need to change any of these
settings.
</aside>

Parameter               | Description
----------------------- | -----------
`version`               | This should match the version of your Inertia CLI, which you can see by running `inertia --version`. It is used to determine which version of the [Inertia daemon](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ubclaunchpad/repository/docker/ubclaunchpad/inertia/) to use.
`name`                  | The name of your remote instance - must be unique.
`ip`                    | This is the address of your remote instance. It's how other users will access your deployed project as well!
`ssh.user`              | The user to use to execute commands as on your remote instance.
`ssh.identityfile`      | The key to use when executing SSH commands on your remote instance.
`ssh.ssh-port`          | The SSH port on your remote instance - you usually don't need to change this.
`daemon.port`           | The port that the Inertia daemon is using - you can usually leave this as is.
`daemon.token`          | This is the token used to authenticate against your remote, and will be populated when you initialize the Inertia daemon later. You can also [log in as a user](#logging-in) to get a token.
`daemon.webhook-secret` | This is used to verify that incoming webhooks are authenticate - [you'll need this later](#configuring-your-repository)!
`daemon.verify-ssl`     | Toggle whether or not to verify SSL communications for the daemon's API - [false by default](#custom-ssl-certificate).

### Profiles

```shell
inertia project profile apply ${profile_name} ${remote_name}
inertia ${remote_name} up
```

The `profiles` section under the remote configuration defines
default profiles to use when deploying a project. If none is configured, Inertia
looks for a profile named `default`.

See the [Project Configuration](#project-configuration) section for how to set
up profiles for your project.

## Initializing the Inertia Daemon

<aside class="notice">
If you used <code>inertia provision</code> to set up your remote, you can skip
this step, as Inertia will have already done all this for you!
</aside>

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} init
# ... lots of output
```

Initializing the Inertia daemon means installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
setting up some prerequisites, downloading the Inertia daemon image, and getting
it up and running. Luckily, this is all done by a single, handy command so you
don't have to worry about it!

The Inertia daemon is a small agent that runs on your VPS instance and handles
all your deployment-related needs, such as responding to commands and listening
for updates to your repository. You can read more about this in the
[Deployment Management](#deployment-management) section.

<aside class="success">
Once this step is done, it means that Inertia and all its prerequisites are now
set up on your VPS, and the Inertia daemon should be up and running! Try
running <code>inertia ${remote_name} status</code> to connect to the daemon.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
This does <b>not</b> completely set up Inertia for project deployment - check
the next step to see what else needs to be done!
</aside>


## Configuring Your Repository

> The `inertia ${remote_name} init` or `provision` command's output should
> include something like the following:

```shell
GitHub Deploy Key (add here https://www.github.com/<your_repo>/settings/keys/new):
ssh-rsa <...> # this is important!
GitHub WebHook URL (add here https://www.github.com/<your_repo>/settings/hooks/new):
http://myhost.com:4303/webhook # this is important!
Github WebHook Secret: inertia # this is important!
```

The `inertia ${remote_name} init` or `provision` command outputs several key
pieces of information to get your repository set up for continuous deployment:

* A deploy key: you need to allow this key read access to your repository. On
  GitHub, this is under your project's "Settings -> Deploy Keys" tab. This will
  allow the Inertia daemon to clone your project.
* A webhook URL and webhook secret: you'll need to register the Inertia daemon
  for webhook updates to let it automatically deploy your latest changes. On
  GitHub, this is under your project's "Settings -> Webhooks" tab.

<aside class="warning">
Unless you've <a href='#custom-ssl-certificate'>set up a custom SSL certificate</a> for your remote, Inertia will use
a self-signed SSL certificate, so you'll have to <b>disable SSL verification</b>
when setting up your webhook registration.
</aside>

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} up
```

<aside class="success">
With your repository now configured correctly, you can now get your project
up and running using the <code>up</code> command!
</aside>

# Deployment Management

> To bring your project online and check its status:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} up
inertia ${remote_name} status
```

> To shut down your project:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} down
```

The main commands used to control your deployed project are `up`, `status`, and
`down`. These commands are associated with the state of your project, not with
that of the Inertia daemon - `inertia ${remote_name} down`, for example, will
*not* shut down the Inertia daemon.

Commands like `up` will provide live output to your terminal. It's pretty normal
for `up` to take a while, depending on the performance of your VPS, as it needs
some time to build your project.

## Monitoring

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} logs
```

> To view the logs of a specific process, get the list of active containers, then
> query for the logs of the container you are interested in:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} status
inertia ${remote_name} logs ${container_name}
```

TODO: details

## Secrets Management

> Environment variables are a good way to store secrets:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} env set ${key} ${value}
```

> If you use configuration files such as a `.env` file, you can "send" it to your
> remote - this file will then become accessible by your project:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} send ${file_name}
```

TODO: details

# Teams

## Configuring Users

> The following command will prompt for a password, and add the given user as
> an administrator:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} user add ${username} --admin
```

> To list existing users:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} user ls
```

> Access can be revoked for a user by removing them:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} user rm ${username}
```

TODO

## Logging In

> If you want to log in to a remote you have already configured as a specific
> user, you can run:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} login ${username}
```

TODO

<aside class="notice">
User tokens expire periodically for security, so you may have to log in again
from time to time.
</aside>

# Upgrading

> Install the latest release - for example, on MacOS:

```shell
brew upgrade ubclaunchpad/tap/inertia
inertia --version # verify installation
```

> To update configuration and daemon to match CLI version:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} upgrade --all
```

TODO

# Advanced Usage

This section details various advanced usage tips. If you can't find what you're
looking for here, try using the `--help` flag on relevant commands - Inertia
will display help text and all the different options available to you.

A complete command reference for the Inertia CLI is also available [here](/cli).
To interact with the daemon API directly, refer to the [API reference](/api).

## Troubleshooting

<aside class="notice">
If you need help, please feel free to
<a href='https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/issues/new/choose'>open a ticket</a>!
</aside>

> To view more of the Inertia daemon's logs (the number of entries retrieved
> is capped by default), run:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} logs --entries 100000
inertia ${remote_name} logs ${container} --entries 100000
```

Inertia is a large and rather complex project, and as such you might encounter
bugs, either because of Inertia or due to some kind of misconfiguration.

The Inertia daemon outputs a lot of verbose logs that might help you out. You
can also make use of the `inertia ${remote} status` command to output details
about the state of your deployment. Also pay attention to the output of the
Inertia CLI when things go awry - it might hint at what happened, and it'll be
useful context if you decide to open a ticket.

> To start an SSH session with your remote, you can use the shortcut:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} ssh
```

If you are more experienced, you can SSH into your remote to investigate. This
lets you access more advanced Docker commands and whatever else you might need
to work out what is happening.

<aside class="warning">
When interacting with your remote over SSH, be wary of manipulating assets that
Inertia depends on such as files in <code>~/inertia/data/</code> and
<code>~/.inertia</code>, as well as build images such as <code>docker/compose</code>.
</aside>

## 2-Factor Authentication

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} user totp enable ${username}
inertia ${remote_name} user totp disable ${username}
```

2-factor authentication configuration in Inertia is available under the
`inertia ${remote_name} user totp` commands.

TOTP stands for "time-based one-time password". Enabling TOTP on an account
means that whenever a user logs in using that account, they must also verify
their identity using a separate authenticator app, which provides a secondary
factor of authentication - hence why it is called "2-factor authentication".

There are a wide range of authenticator apps out there, for example:

* [Authy for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)
* [Authy for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en)

> To log in as a totp-enabled user, you'll have to provide your TOTP or backup
> code as a flag:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} user login ${username} --totp ${code}
```

When you enable TOTP on an account, Inertia will output a QR code that you can
scan using your authenticator app, as well as a list of backup codes you should
keep somewhere safe. When you log in using a TOTP-enabled account, you'll need
to provide the TOTP generated by your authenticator app to log in, or one of the
backup codes.

## Resource Management

> To clear out unused Docker images and containers:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} prune
```

> You can also interact with Docker directly over SSH:

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} ssh
root@remote:~$ docker container ls -a
```

Inertia does its best to manage resources on its own, but sometimes spare
containers and images start gathering and you might find your remote starting
to run out of storage (especially if it is a free/budget instance with low
storage).

Inertia offers a few ways of managing resources, either through commands like
`prune` or directly over SSH.

<aside class="warning">
When interacting with your remote over SSH, be wary of manipulating assets that
Inertia depends on such as files in <code>~/inertia/data/</code> and
<code>~/.inertia</code>, as well as build images such as <code>docker/compose</code>.
</aside>

## Generating API Keys

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} token
```

If you want to develop integrations with Inertia, you'll probably want a
non-expiring API token, which you can generate using Inertia if you have SSH
access to your remote. Be careful not to lose these tokens.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" \
  https://${remote_ip}:${daemon_port}/status
```

To use these tokens, you can place them in your `inertia.toml` under `token`, or
use them in requests to the Inertia API by placing them as a `Bearer` token in
your request header under `Authorization`.

## Inertia Release Streams

The version of Inertia you are using can be seen in Inertia's `inertia.toml`
configuration file, or by running `inertia --version`. The version in
`inertia.toml` is used to determine what version of the Inertia daemon to use
when you run `inertia ${remote_name} init`.

> To switch over to the latest build and upgrade your remote:

```shell
inertia config set version "latest"
inertia ${remote_name} upgrade
```

You can manually change the daemon version used by editing the Inertia
configuration file. If you are building from source, you can also check out the
desired version and run `make inertia-tagged` or `make RELEASE=$STREAM`.
Inertia daemon releases are tagged as follows:

- `v0.x.x` denotes [official, tagged releases](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/releases) - these are recommended.
- `latest` denotes the newest builds on `master`.
- `canary` denotes experimental builds used for testing and development - do not use this.

You can see the list of available tags on
[Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ubclaunchpad/repository/docker/ubclaunchpad/inertia/tags).

## Custom SSL Certificate

By default, the Inertia daemon generates a self-signed SSL certificate for its
API. This means that Inertia, by default, doesn't verify SSL communications,
and you'll have to do things like disable SSL verification in your repository
for webhooks.

```shell
inertia ${remote_name} --verify-ssl status
```

If you provide your own SSL certificate, you can enable SSL verification in
Inertia using the `--verify-ssl` flag, and enable SSL verification in your
repository's webhook deliveries as well.

Just place your SSL certificate and key on your remote in `~/.inertia/ssl` as
`daemon.cert` and `daemon.key` respectively, and the Inertia daemon will use
them automatically.
